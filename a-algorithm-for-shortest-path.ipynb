The **f-value** is a measure of how close the node is to the goal node, taking into account the cost of getting to the node and the estimated cost of getting from the node to the goal node.\n\nThe A* algorithm is made up of three main components:\n\n* **G(start, node)**: This function represents the cumulative weight from the start node to the current node.\n* **Transitions(node)**: This function returns all of the successors (or neighbors) of the current node.\n* **Heuristic function**: This function provides an estimate of the distance to the goal node from the current node.\n\nThe A* algorithm works by iteratively expanding the node with the lowest f-value. For each node that is expanded, the algorithm calculates the tentative f-value of each of its successors. The tentative f-value is calculated by adding the cost of getting to the successor node to the heuristic estimate of the cost of getting from the successor node to the goal node.\n\nThe algorithm then adds the successors with the lowest tentative f-values to the open list. The open list is a priority queue that stores the nodes that need to be expanded next. The algorithm continues to expand nodes until it reaches the goal node or the open list is empty.\n\n\n## Additional\n\nIn addition to the three main components, the A* algorithm also typically uses a number of additional tools , such as:\n\n* **Closed list**: The closed list stores the nodes that have already been expanded. The algorithm uses the closed list to prevent itself from re-expanding the same node multiple times.\n* **Open list**: The open list stores the nodes that need to be expanded next. The algorithm uses the open list to prioritize the nodes that should be expanded first.\n* **Path reconstruction function**: This function takes the goal node as input and returns the shortest path from the start node to the goal node.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Simple Implementaion using Python\n\nLet's start by examining what we have: a graph made up of nodes, costs, heuristics, start, and goal.
